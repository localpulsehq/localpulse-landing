Competitor benchmarks give context, not anxiety. A small rating gap is common,
especially when review volume is low.

If you understand why rating gaps exist, you can decide whether to ignore them,
close them quickly, or stop wasting energy on the wrong metric.

<BlogSection title="Understanding the gap">
  <p>
    Rating gaps feel dramatic when you are staring at a decimal. In practice,
    a gap under 0.2 often means nothing if review volume is low or recent.
  </p>

  <BlogCallout title="Rule of thumb">
    Under 0.2 stars is noise. At low review counts, a single experience can move the average more than day-to-day operations. Focus on volume and recent trends 
    before chasing tiny swings.
  </BlogCallout>

  <p>
    A café with 40 reviews can shift its rating meaningfully in weeks. A café with 400 reviews cannot.
    The same operational change produces very different outcomes depending on volume.

<BlogSection title="How ratings move over time">
  <p>
    Ratings are weighted by history. High volume cafes move slowly; low volume
    cafes move quickly. That is why review velocity matters more than the
    lifetime score.
  </p>

  <BlogCallout title="What moves the needle">
    Velocity determines how fast change shows. Fix the last 30 days, not the
    lifetime score.
  </BlogCallout>

<BlogSection title="How to respond without overreacting">
  <p>
    Use the gap as a signal, not a verdict. Look at recent feedback themes,
    decide whether the gap is growing, and focus on one operational fix at a
    time.

    How to interpret your gap in practice
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If your gap is under 0.2, ignore it and focus on volume.</li>
    <li>If your gap is growing, check the last 30 days of reviews.</li>
    <li>If your volume is low, improve experience first, then ask.</li>
    <li>If competitor volume is high, optimize consistency, not spikes.</li>
  </ul>
